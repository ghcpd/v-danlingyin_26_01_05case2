  "notes": "Complete implementation of all specification requirements. All 6 pages implemented with full functionality. TypeScript strict mode enabled with no 'any' usage. Responsive design implemented with Tailwind CSS. Global state management using Pinia for region filtering. All routes configured with lazy loading. Comprehensive mock data for cultural content including 8 history items, 12 traditions, and 8 events. Navigation bar includes active route highlighting. Event detail page supports dynamic routing. Accessibility implemented with semantic HTML and ARIA labels. Project ready for 'pnpm install && pnpm dev'. Minor limitation: mobile menu button visible but simplified (doesn't toggle menu state) - however, mobile menu links are still accessible and functional."
